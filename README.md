Repository for all coding related files. Feel free to upload documents/databases/datafiles relating to the project.

fromACC defines classes and functions for use in calculating quadrupole moments and wave strains. fromACC2 has slightly modified wave strain calculators to be more compatible with data from imported csv files.

binary_orbit.csv has example data for two stars orbiting eachother.

animated_plots.ipynb shows how to use the classes and functions defined in fromACC to plot and animate the trajectory and wave strains for a given data set.
