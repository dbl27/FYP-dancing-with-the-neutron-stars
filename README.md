scripts.py contains the finalised versions of whatever functions have been written; e.g. functions to calculate quadrupole moments and its derivatives for given masses.

test_functions.ipynb serves as a location to test these functions with example data sets. Mainly here for troubleshooting / learning how the functions work.

qdrpl_calcs.ipynb contains unfinished / ongoing writing for code and functions that are aimed to be put in scripts.py onced finalised.
